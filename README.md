# Text RPG

## Notes
- My attempt at creating a story driven text RPG to pass the time during the COVID quarantine.
- Use JavaFX to formulate UI, maybe seek to using Unity once code and structure is closer to a completed state.
- 2 or 3 saved files and work on the strucutre of reading and writing the save files.
- Look into setCaretPosition() for autoscroll on the text area.
