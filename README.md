# TextRPG

## About The Project

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I was unable to find neither a job nor an internship for the summer of 2020. While I have large passion 
for gaming, I did not want to spend the summer aimlessly playing them for hours on end. I decided to practice using multiple Java APIs 
and how to logical solve a problem and write code for it. At first, I spent time solving challenges on edabit, but then I decided to 
approach a larger scale project. I decided to write code for a GUI for evolving cellular automatons using Wolfram code, which can be
found here (https://github.com/knguy7643/WolframCodeGUI). Upon completion of this, I began trying to create of text-based, story-driven 
RPG using JavaFx. At first, I thought the idea of Unity Game Engine to design a 2D game seemed intimidating, but I decided that there was
more that I could do for a 2D game using Unity than just JavaFx. In this github will be the assets and scripts that I have for my game in 
Unity so far. Unity also provided me with the opportunity to learn C#.
